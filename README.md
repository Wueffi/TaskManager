**Task Manager** is a Fabric mod that shows you how your mods are performing while the game runs. Press **F12** (or whatever keybind you set) to open the screen at any time without pausing the game.

**Tasks** shows all your loaded mods and how much CPU time each one is using. You can see which mods are slowing your game down the most. Mods using a lot of time show up in red, medium in yellow, and low in green.
